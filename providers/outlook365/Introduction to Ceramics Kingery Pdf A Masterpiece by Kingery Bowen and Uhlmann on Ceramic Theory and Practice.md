To apply a preset, just double-click on it and it will be added to your scene.

If you want to create your own custom light setup from scratch, you can use the Add Light button at the top of the window to add different types of lights to your scene. You can choose from softboxes, spotlights, ring lights, overhead lights, ambient lights, and more. You can then edit each light individually or as a group by using the same sliders and modifiers as before.
