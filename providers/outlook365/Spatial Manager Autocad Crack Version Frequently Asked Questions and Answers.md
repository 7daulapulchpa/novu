Spatial Managerâ¢ for AutodeskÂ® AutoCADÂ® is a powerful AutoCAD plug-in designed for AutoCAD users who need to import, export, transform and manage spatial data in a simple, fast and inexpensive way, which includes many functionalities not seen so far in AutoCAD[^1^] [^2^]. In this article, we will show you how to use some of the key features of Spatial Manager for AutoCAD to enhance your spatial data workflows.
 
## Importing Spatial Data into AutoCAD
 
Spatial Manager for AutoCAD allows you to import spatial data from various sources, such as spatial files (SHP, KML, GPX, etc.), data servers (PostGIS, SQL Server, etc.), or data stores (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.), into new or existing AutoCAD drawings. You can import the spatial data as AutoCAD objects and Extended Entity Data (EED/XDATA), which allows you to store additional information about the objects. You can also apply geometric transformations of the objects during the import process, such as scaling, rotating, or projecting them to a different coordinate system[^1^].

To import spatial data into AutoCAD using Spatial Manager for AutoCAD, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Open an existing drawing or create a new one.
2. Click on the Import button on the Spatial Manager toolbar or ribbon.
3. Select the source of the spatial data from the drop-down list. You can choose from a list of predefined providers or add your own custom providers.
4. Browse or enter the path to the spatial file, data server, or data store that you want to import.
5. Select the options for importing the spatial data, such as the target layer, the object type, the coordinate system, the transformation parameters, etc.
6. Click on OK to start the import process.

You will see a progress bar showing the status of the import process. When it is finished, you will see a message indicating the number of objects imported and any errors or warnings that occurred. You can also check the log file for more details. You will then see the imported spatial data in your drawing as AutoCAD objects with EED/XDATA attached.
 
## Exporting Spatial Data from AutoCAD
 
Spatial Manager for AutoCAD also allows you to export spatial data from your drawing to spatial files or databases. You can export all or selected objects from your drawing and save their EED/XDATA as alphanumeric data tables. You can also apply geometric transformations of the objects during the export process[^1^].

1. Select the objects that you want to export from your drawing. If you do not select any objects, all objects in the visible layers will be exported.
2. Click on the Export button on the Spatial Manager toolbar or ribbon.
3. Select the destination of the spatial data from the drop-down list. You can choose from a list of predefined providers or add your own custom providers.
4. Browse or enter the path to the spatial file or database that you want to export.
5. Select the options for exporting the spatial data, such as the source layer, the object type, the coordinate system, the transformation parameters, etc.
6. Click on OK to start the export process.

You will see a progress bar showing the status of the export process. When it is finished, you will see a message indicating the number of objects exported and any errors or warnings that occurred. You can also check the log file for more details. You will then find your exported spatial data in your chosen destination as a spatial file or database with alphanumeric data tables attached.
 
## Displaying Background Maps
 
Spatial Manager for AutoCAD also allows you to display dynamic background maps in your drawing from various providers such as Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, Bing, MapBox, Ordnance Survey, etc., or configure your own maps from TMS, WMS or WMTS servers. The background maps are geo-referenced according to your drawing coordinate system and scale automatically as you zoom or pan
