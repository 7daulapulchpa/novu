# How to activate the Smart Array Advanced Pack on HP Smart Array P410i controller
 
The HP Smart Array P410i is an 8-port SAS RAID controller that can be upgraded with the Smart Array Advanced Pack (SAAP) to enable additional features such as RAID 6, RAID 60, Advanced Capacity Expansion, and more. However, to activate the SAAP, you need a valid license key that can be purchased from HP or obtained as an evaluation key for 60 days.
 
In this article, we will show you how to install and activate the SAAP license key on your HP Smart Array P410i controller using the HP Smart Storage Administrator (SSA) utility.

## Prerequisites
 
- A server with an HP Smart Array P410i controller installed and configured.
- A compatible battery or capacitor for the controller's cache module. The cache module is required for some SAAP features such as RAID 6 and RAID 60.
- An internet connection to download the SSA utility and the SAAP license key.

## Steps

1. Download the SSA utility from [https://www.hpe.com/us/en/servers/smart-array-controllers-and-smart-host-bus-adapters.html](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/servers/smart-array-controllers-and-smart-host-bus-adapters.html) and install it on your server. The SSA utility is available for various operating systems such as Windows, Linux, VMware ESXi, etc.
2. Download the SAAP license key from [https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/swd/public/detail?swItemId=MTX\_9c4b7f0f0e5c4d3c8b0b7e9f4f](https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/swd/public/detail?swItemId=MTX_9c4b7f0f0e5c4d3c8b0b7e9f4f) and save it as a text file on your server. The license key is a 25-character alphanumeric code that looks like this: 34T62-N84MB-7DQGY-G7XGT-YTQ63. This is an evaluation key that will expire after 60 days. To obtain a permanent key, you need to purchase it from HP.
3. Launch the SSA utility and select your HP Smart Array P410i controller from the list of devices.
4. Click on the "Settings" tab and then click on "Manage License Keys".
5. Click on "Add License Key" and browse to the text file that contains the SAAP license key. Click on "OK" to confirm.
6. The SSA utility will verify the license key and activate the SAAP features on your controller. You should see a message like this: "License Key successfully installed".
7. Click on "OK" and then close the SSA utility.

## Conclusion
 
You have successfully activated the Smart Array Advanced Pack on your HP Smart Array P410i controller. You can now use the SSA utility or other tools to create and manage RAID arrays with enhanced features such as RAID 6, RAID 60, Advanced Capacity Expansion, etc. For more information about the SAAP features and how to use them, please refer to the [HP Smart Array P410 Controller User Guide](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=c04111713).
  
## Troubleshooting
 
If you encounter any issues while activating the SAAP license key on your controller, here are some possible solutions:

- Make sure you have the latest firmware version for your controller. You can download the firmware from [https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/home/driverHome?sp4ts.oid=3902578](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/home/driverHome?sp4ts.oid=3902578) and install it using the SSA utility or other methods.
- Make sure you have a compatible battery or capacitor for your controller's cache module. The cache module is required for some SAAP features such as RAID 6 and RAID 60. You can check the status of your battery or capacitor using the SSA utility or other tools.
- Make sure you have entered the correct license key. The license key is case-sensitive and should not contain any spaces or hyphens. You can copy and paste the license key from the text file to avoid typing errors.
- If you have purchased a permanent license key from HP, make sure you have registered it with your HP account and activated it online. You can do this by following the instructions on [https://www.hpe.com/us/en/resources/integrated-systems/smart-array-advanced-pack.html](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/resources/integrated-systems/smart-array-advanced-pack.html).
- If you have used an evaluation license key, make sure it has not expired. The evaluation license key will expire after 60 days from the date of installation. You can check the expiration date using the SSA utility or other tools.
