# Advanced C Programming by Example: A Book Review
 
If you are looking for a book that will help you improve your C programming skills, you might want to check out *Advanced C Programming by Example* by John W. Perry. This book is intended for intermediate-level C programmers who want to take their skills to the next level. It covers topics such as ANSI C libraries, dynamic data structures, string parsing and numeric conversion, memory management, bit-level manipulation, interactions with operating systems, and other advanced techniques.
 
The book is practical, example-driven, and code-centered. It presents actual C code rather than pseudocode to illustrate how to implement abstract ideas successfully. The book also provides exercises and solutions at the end of each chapter to help you practice and test your knowledge. The book was published in 1998 by PWS Publishing Co. and has 320 pages.

- You will learn how to use the standard C library functions effectively and efficiently.
- You will understand how to design and manipulate complex data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- You will master how to parse and process strings and numbers using various methods and algorithms.
- You will gain insight into how memory is allocated and freed in C, and how to avoid memory leaks and errors.
- You will discover how to perform low-level operations on bits and bytes, such as bitwise operations, bit fields, bit masks, and bit vectors.
- You will explore how to interact with the operating system using system calls, signals, pipes, sockets, and file I/O.

Some of the drawbacks of this book are:

- The book is outdated and does not cover some of the newer features of C such as C99 or C11 standards.
- The book assumes that you have a solid background in C and does not review the basic concepts or syntax of the language.
- The book is not suitable for beginners or advanced programmers who are looking for more depth or complexity in their topics.

In conclusion, *Advanced C Programming by Example* by John W. Perry is a useful book for intermediate-level C programmers who want to learn more about the practical aspects of C programming. It covers a wide range of topics and provides clear examples and exercises to help you apply what you learn. However, the book is not very current and does not cover some of the newer features of C. It also assumes that you have a good grasp of C basics and does not provide much theory or explanation behind the concepts. Therefore, you might want to supplement this book with other sources or books that are more up-to-date or comprehensive.
