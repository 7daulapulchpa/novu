# How to Watch Avatar with Subtitles for the Na'vi Language Only
 
Avatar is a 2009 epic science fiction film directed by James Cameron that features a fictional alien race called the Na'vi, who live on the moon Pandora. The film uses a mix of English and Na'vi languages, with subtitles for the latter. However, some viewers may prefer to watch the film without subtitles for the English parts, and only have subtitles for the Na'vi parts. This can enhance the immersion and realism of the film, as well as challenge the viewers to understand the context and emotions of the characters without relying on words.
 
Fortunately, there are several ways to watch Avatar with subtitles for the Na'vi language only. Here are some of them:

- Download a subtitle file that only contains the Na'vi parts from a website such as opensubtitles.com[^1^] or subdl.com[^2^]. You can then load the subtitle file into your media player of choice, such as VLC or MPC-HC, and sync it with the video file. Make sure to choose a subtitle file that matches the resolution and format of your video file, such as 1080p BluRay x264.
- Buy or rent a Blu-ray or DVD copy of Avatar that has an option to select subtitles for the Na'vi language only. This option may not be available in all regions or editions, so check the product description or reviews before purchasing. You can then play the disc on your Blu-ray or DVD player, or rip it to your computer using a software such as MakeMKV.
- Stream Avatar online from a platform that has an option to select subtitles for the Na'vi language only. This option may not be available in all platforms or regions, so check the availability and settings before streaming. Some examples of platforms that offer this option are Amazon Prime Video, iTunes, and Google Play Movies.

Whichever method you choose, you can enjoy watching Avatar with subtitles for the Na'vi language only and experience the film in a new and exciting way.
  
If you are wondering why the Na'vi language is so fascinating and complex, it is because it was created by a linguist named Paul Frommer. He was hired by James Cameron to develop a language that would sound alien but realistic, and that would reflect the culture and environment of the Na'vi. He based the language on features from various human languages, such as ergativity, ejectives, and infixes. He also created a vocabulary of over 2,000 words, and a grammar system that allows for word formation and variation.
 
The Na'vi language is not only used in the film, but also in other media related to Avatar, such as video games, books, comics, and theme park attractions. There are also fan communities that learn and use the language for fun and communication. You can find online resources such as dictionaries, courses, podcasts, and forums to help you learn the Na'vi language. You can also join groups and events that organize Na'vi language activities and meetups.
