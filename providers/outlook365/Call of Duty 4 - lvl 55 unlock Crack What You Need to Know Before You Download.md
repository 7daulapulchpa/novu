## Multiplayer Tips and Tricks
  
To succeed in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare multiplayer, you will need more than just good aim and reflexes. You will also need to use your weapons, perks, and tactics wisely. Here are some tips and tricks to help you improve your game:

- Use your radar: Your radar shows you the location of your teammates, enemies, objectives, and power-ups. Pay attention to it and use it to plan your moves and avoid surprises.
- Customize your class: You can create your own custom class by choosing your primary weapon, secondary weapon, grenade type, perk 1, perk 2, and perk 3. Experiment with different combinations and find what suits your playstyle best.
- Use cover: Don't expose yourself unnecessarily to enemy fire. Use walls, buildings, vehicles, and other objects as cover and peek out only when you have a clear shot.
- Move around: Don't stay in one spot for too long or you will become an easy target for snipers, grenades, and airstrikes. Move around the map and flank your enemies from unexpected angles.
- Communicate with your team: Use your microphone or chat function to communicate with your teammates. Share information, coordinate attacks, call out enemies, and request backup.
- Use killstreaks: You can earn killstreak rewards by getting consecutive kills without dying. These rewards include UAVs, airstrikes, and helicopters that can give you an edge over your enemies. Use them wisely and don't waste them.
